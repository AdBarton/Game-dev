# Game-dev
Own project created in team of 3 students for student event called "Noc Vědců"

Url: http://hideseek.fm.tul.cz/

Hide&Seek on url is older version of game. The newer have been made this year(get some graphics and game changing functions) for school project and connection to 
next year of Noc Vědců. 

"Just for comparison"
I recommend firstly play the old version of game on browser(url) and after that look at video of the new one.

Warning: Unity is not compatible with every browser and does not support Safari, Opera and other. It possible to may not start.
